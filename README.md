Weather App (Open weather API + unsplash API)

A very simple API app which also changes the Background image according to the City name that's been searched.

API 1 : "openweathermap" api to extract the weather information of the given city/location.

API 2 : Unsplash API to change the background image according to the given city/location.


PS: The image API (unsplash) will also search for any random keyword you put there, so it'll always show some image.
    For example - "burger" won't load any weather information if typed in the search bar, but it'll show some burger
                  image in the background.
