<strong>Weather App (Open weather API + unsplash API)</strong>

A very simple <b>Weather App</b> which also changes the Background image according to the City name that's been searched.

API 1 : "openweathermap" api to get the weather information of the given city/location.

API 2 : Unsplash API to change the background image according to the given city/location.


<i>PS:  The image API (unsplash) will also search for any random keyword you put there, so it'll always show some image.
     For example - "chicken" won't load any weather information if typed in the search bar, but it'll show some chicken
                  image in the background.</i>
